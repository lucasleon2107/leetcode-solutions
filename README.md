# Kotlin LeetCode Solutions

A collection of my LeetCode solutions written in Kotlin.  
Each problem lives in its own folder with a simple `solution.kt` file.

### Structure
- `xxx-problem-name/solution.kt` contains the implementation.

### Notes
- Focused on clear, idiomatic Kotlin.

Feel free to explore or reuse any part of the code.
